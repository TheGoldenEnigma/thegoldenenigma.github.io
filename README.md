## Trying Github Pages

My name is Swarnima and I am a Seattle based Software Engineer by profession. I am currently working with Amazon Alexa. I have also worked with various services in Amazon Web Services like Elastic Block Store, Cloudfront, Lambda@Edge and Global Infrastructure. Prior to this I graduated from State University of New York at Stony Brook where I pursued my Master of Science in Computer Science. I did my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India following which I worked with companies like Verizon and Oracle for few years back in India.

Outside work, travel and nature photography are my all time favorite hobbies. I also enjoy playing all types of racquet sports and several card games. I am fond of playing Chess and Board Games too. My taste in music is mediocre but lyrics get to the core of my heart. My friends say I can be a good script or dialogue writer. Weirdly though, I donâ€™t watch a lot of shows or movies. Talking about movies, The Pursuit of Happyness and The Imitation Game are my all time favorites. In the past, I have tried my hands on guitar and painting but failed miserably. Swimming and Power Yoga is something I aspire to learn next.
